# SBDEPS CNN Model
A CNN Model trained for Satellite-Based Detection of Electric Parking Stations, This code was created for a Deep Learning Project in 2025.


To validate on a labeled custom dataset...

1. Create a folder "eparking" with two subfolders "y" & "n"
2. Save labeled images in "eparking" folder (y = with Charging Station, n = without)
3. Open and run main.ipynb (if necessary create environment or install libraries)
